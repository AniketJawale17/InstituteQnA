What is Ragging,"3
Ragging encompasses a wide range of behaviours and actions that can have 
severe detrimental effects on the victim. The following points elaborate on the 
various forms of ragging, which include but are not limited to :  
1. Teasing and Rudeness:  
This involves any conduct by one or more students, whether through 
spoken or written words, or through actions, that has the effect of teasing, 
treating, or handling a fresher or any other student with rudeness. Such 
behaviour can manifest as making fun of an individual, mocking their 
appearance, behaviour, or background, and using derogatory or demeaning 
language. This form of ragging undermines the self -esteem and dignity of 
the targeted student. 
2. Rowdy and Undisciplined Activities:  
Engaging in rowdy or undisciplined activities that cause or are likely to 
cause annoyance, hardship, physical or psychological harm, or instil fear 
or apprehension in any fresher or other student. These activities disrupt the 
peace and order of the  campus environment and create a climate of fear 
and intimidation. Such behaviour can severely impact the victim's sense of 
security and well-being. 
3. Forced Actions:  
Compelling any student to perform an act that they would not ordinarily 
undertake, resulting in a sense of shame, torment, or embarrassment. This 
includes forcing students to engage in degrading tasks, consume harmful 
substances, or participate in activities against their will. Such coercion 
adversely affects the physical and psychological heal th of the victim, 
leading to long-lasting trauma.","2
